      <h3>Design and Development</h3>
      <p>I started learning to draw to help capture the beauty I feel and see. By age 14, my work has been represented in mediums including a Florida elementary school to a Warner Bros. and DC Comics collaborated animated TV series. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing art to be showcased in as many mediums our intricate planet earth can allow.</p>
